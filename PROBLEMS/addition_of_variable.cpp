Write a program which does the following

* Declare two variables a and b
* Assign the value 23 to a and 20 to b
* Output the sum of a and b to the console



SOLUTION:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a = 23 ;      //Assign the value 23 to a
  int b = 20 ;      //Assign the value 20 to b
  cout << a + b ;   //cout the desired output
  return 0;
}
