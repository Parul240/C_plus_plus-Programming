                                                                DO WHILE LOOP




* In C++, a do-while loop is a control flow statement that executes a block of code at least once, and then repeats the execution of the block of code as long as the specified condition is true. 

* The basic syntax of a do-while loop is as follows:

                                  +------------------------------------+
                                  |      do {                          |
                                  |         // code to be executed     |
                                  |     } while(condition);            |
                                  |                                    |
                                  +----------------------------------- + 

                                    
* The do-while loop consists of the following parts:

    - The keyword do which indicates the start of the loop.
    - The block of code to be executed, enclosed in curly braces { }.
    - The keyword while which indicates the end of the loop.
    - The condition to be checked for each iteration of the loop, which is specified inside the parentheses ( ) following the keyword while.
